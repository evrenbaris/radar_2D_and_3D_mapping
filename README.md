# Radar Map Visualization

This project simulates a radar system that visualizes targets in 2D and 3D space, with an option to track their dynamic movements.

## Features
- Simulates target positions in 2D and 3D space.
- Visualizes static radar maps.
- Tracks target movements over time using animation.

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**: Programming language.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizations and animations.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/radar-map-visualization.git
   cd radar-map-visualization
